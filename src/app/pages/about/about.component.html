            H. A. Dharmasena began making guitars when he was a teenager. Now
            eighty, he’s still making them. Guitar making definitely runs in the
            family. His son Kithsiri Hathurusinghe dropped the idea of becoming
            a doctor and joined his father to make guitars. And now, 23-year-old
            grandson Bhagya Madhushan too, is in the spacious workshop at home,
            making guitars. From their modest home in Kolonnawa, these
            three-generation guitar-making families make and sell guitars all
            over the country. But Dharmasena sounds like a disappointed man,
            talking about lost opportunities and lack of appreciation towards a
            craftsman working hard to compete with cheap imports from China and
            India. “We can make guitars as good as any in the world,” Dharmasena
            says. “But we need support from the Government, which we have never
            been given.” Things were better before the open economy opened a
            floodgate to cheap imports in 1978. But Dharmasena recalls T. B.
            Ilangaratne, Minister of Trade for the socialist Government elected
            in 1970, objecting to a deal offered by an American guitar maker
            impressed with his home-made guitars. "T. B. Ilangaratne, Minister
            of Trade for the socialist Government elected in 1970, objecting to
            a deal offered by an American guitar maker impressed with his
            home-made guitars" Even so, the 60s and 70s were good times
            comparatively, when Dharmasena had dealers selling his products all
            over the country. He had assistants and his firm made not only
            guitars but violins, too. “I stopped making violins after cheap
            Chinese products flooded the market, but I kept this as a souvenir,”
            Dharmasena said, showing me a beautifully finished sample. Though he
            started making guitars at age 16, the first musical instrument he
            touched was an English mandolin. But it’s the guitar, which seized
            his mind and imagination as he became acquainted with a man who
            repaired guitars. Though he never learned to play the instrument,
            Dharmasena quickly grasped the essentials of making an acoustic
            guitar. Today, half-finished guitars hang in parts of the family
            workshop. One made by Dharmasena over 40 years ago has returned to
            the workshop for a repair. Other guitars ranging from an electric
            bass to a lead guitar lie on tables, as the firm undertakes repairs,
            too. "A popular Music Company made an offer once. But the company
            wanted us to sign a contract very much in their favour, forcing us
            to supply guitars at a fixed rate for five years. That was simply
            too risky " The firm, known as New Tone, has an outlet at
            Wellawatte, but the sons, as well as a grandson, are content to be
            in the workshop. One can see that this is their universe. Every
            guitar is hand-made, with a metal mould being used to shape the wood
            into the familiar bulbous shape of the guitar frame. Imported
            hardwoods are needed for the fingerboard, but the body is made from
            local woods such as mahogany. Teak, Jak-wood and satinwood are too
            hard. It takes a single craftsman one week to finish a guitar, and
            another week to finish the paintwork. Clear weather is needed for
            the painting as the workshop isn’t humidity-controlled, and applying
            the gums too, cannot be done when it rains. Dharmasena is
            pessimistic about the future, but remains confident that his son and
            grandson will continue the family tradition. "The struggle this
            guitar maker and his family have waged in the face of adversity and
            market forces unleashed by changing times is nothing short of
            heroic" No Lankan business concern has thought of investing in this
            guitar making venture. All such offers have come from abroad. But,
            due to bad luck and other mitigating factors, nothing has worked for
            them. “Even a popular Music Company made an offer once. But the
            company wanted us to sign a contract very much in their favour,
            forcing us to supply guitars at a fixed rate for five years. That
            was simply too risky, so we turned it down,” Dharmasena said. The
            struggle this guitar maker and his family have waged in the face of
            adversity and market forces unleashed by changing times is nothing
            short of heroic. One senses a strong will to persevere against the
            odds.
